.SH NAME
simple_shell \- simple UNIX command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
[\fifile\fR]


.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsimple_shell\fR program is a minimalist implementation of a command-line interpreter, similar to the traditional Bourne shell (\fBsh\fR).


It reads commands from the standard input or from a script file, executes them, and displays the output to the standard output.


.SH FEATURES
- Interactive mode: displays a prompt and waits for user commands.
- Non-interactive mode: reads commands from a file or piped input.
- Supports built-in commands: \fBexit\fR and \fBenv\fR.
- Executes external programs located using the system's \fBPATH\fR enviroment variable.
- Graceful handling of invalid commands and errors.


.SH USAGES
To compile the shell:

.B gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh

To start the shell:

.B ./hsh

Once the shell is running, type any command and press Enter:

.EXAMPLE
$ ./hsh
$ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 0 Apr 14 19:25 file1
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 0 Apr 14 19:25 file2

In non-interactive mode:

$ echo "ls -l" | ./hsh
